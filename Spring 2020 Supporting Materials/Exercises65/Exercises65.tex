Sally is a healthy individual with no prominent risk factors or biomarkers for pancreatic cancer.  What is the probability that she will get pancreatic cancer?

Scenario 1 (hard evidence):
family = 1, pancreatitis = 1, eus = 1, mri = 1, jaundice = 1, diabetes = 1, ca19 = 1, weight = 1, abdominal = 1

Probability: 0.3\%

Robert has diabetes and has a family history of pancreatic cancer.  Because of these risk factors, he underwent a test for pancreatic scan and was found to have a positive MRI.  What is the probability that he will get pancreatic cancer?

Scenario 2 (hard evidence):
family = 2, pancreatitis = 1, mri = 2, jaundice = 1, diabetes = 2, weight = 1, abdominal =1

Probability: 2.1\%

{\bf 3.} Jennifer has a family history of pancreatic cancer as well as chronic pancreatitis.  It is known that she has high levels of the biomarker CA 19-9 in the body.  She has recently been experiencing abdominal pains.  What is the probability that she will get pancreatic cancer?

Scenario 3 (hard evidence):
family = 2, pancreatitis = 2, jaundice = 1, diabetes = 1, ca19 = 2, weight = 1, abdominal = 2

Probability: 15.7\%

{\bf 4.} Sam has lost weight recently due to the fact that he has been diagnosed with jaundice.  Because jaundice is a risk factor to pancreatic cancer he had a screening done.  One of the results from his screening stated that he had elevated levels of CA 19-9.  What is the probability that he has pancreatic cancer?

Scenario 4 (hard evidence):
family = 1, pancreatitis = 1, jaundice = 2, diabetes = 1, ca19 = 2, weight = 2, abdominal = 1

Probability: 31.2\%

{\bf 5.}
Ava has been developing many health problems recently. She has been diagnosed with diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, and jaundice. She also has a family history of pancreatic cancer.  She has recently been having abdominal pains as well as unexpected weight loss.  When tested for pancreatic cancer the results show elevated levels for CA 19-9 and positive results with both EUS-FNA(biopsy) and MRI.  What is the probability she has pancreatic cancer?

Scenario 5 (hard evidence):
family = 2, pancreatitis = 2, eus = 2, mri =2, jaundice = 2, diabetes = 2, ca19 = 2, weight = 2, abdominal = 2

Probability: 83.9\%

\noindent {\bf Moon Illusion~}
Make Doodle Plot that corresponds to the code bellow.


Kaufman and Rock (1962) concluded that the commonly 
observed fact that the moon near the horizon appears larger 
than does the moon at its zenith (highest point overhead) 
could be explained on the basis of the greater  apparent
distance of the moon when it is at the horizon. As part of a 
very complete series  of experiments, the authors initially
sought to estimate the moon horizon  so as to match the size
of a standard ``moon'' that appeared at its zenith,  
or vice versa. (In these measurements, they used not the 
actual moon but an artificial one created with special
apparatus.) One of the first questions we might ask is 
whether there really is a moon illusion - that is, whether
a larger setting is required to match a horizon moon or 
a zenith moon. The following data for 10 subjects are 
taken from Kaufman and Rock's paper and represent 
the ratio of the diameter of the variable and standard 
moons. A ratio of 1.00 would indicate no illusion, whereas 
a ratio other than 1.00 would represent an illusion.
(For example, a ratio of 1.50 would mean that the 
horizon moon appeared to have a diameter 1.50 times 
the diameter of the zenith moon.)
      
Evidence in support of an illusion would require that we
reject $H_0: \mu = 1.00 $ in favor of $H_1: \mu > 1.00.$
