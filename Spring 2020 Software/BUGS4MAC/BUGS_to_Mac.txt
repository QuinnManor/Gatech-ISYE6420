Instructions for loading WinBUGS in Mac/Linux systems. Suggestions are from my Spring 2015 class. 



Suggestion 1 (Jen Teshera-Levye) : 


1. WINE is available free and open source for Linux and Mac to run (some) Windows programs. 
WinBUGS should work pretty well because it's no longer updating.

 2. To install WINE, go to the website: 
https://www.winehq.org/ (If you use Linux with a package manager, it should be in most standard repositories. 
 
  For Debian/Ubuntu - sudo apt-get install wine.) Installing Wine will ask you to create a "C" drive 
and set it up as if it's a Windows file system.

3. Download the WinBUGS executable file, and right click
 to install using Wine. It'll probably be slow - be patient.

4. To install the patch and key file,
 download these and put them somewhere in Wine's drive_c folder so you can access them from WinBUGS's file menu. 

   This might be a hidden folder - home/.wine/drive_c (not sure how this will be created on a mac,
 that's how it works in Linux.) From here, you should 
   just be able to follow the instructions on the WinBUGS web
site.






Suggestion 2 (James Normington): 

1. Download Wine from https://www.winehq.org/download/ubuntu2
2. 
Download XQuartz 2.7.7 from http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/ if you don't have X11 installed for Mac
3.
 Download a "zipped version of the whole file structure" from 

http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/the-bugs-project-winbugs/


4. Copy all of the text in 

http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/WinBUGS14_cumulative_patch_No3_06_08_07_RELEASE.txt
5. 

In WinBUGS: File > New > paste the text > Tools > Decode
6. 
Copy all of the text in http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/WinBUGS14_immortality_key.txt
7. 
In WinBUGS: File > New > paste the text > Tools > Decode






Suggestion 3 
(Austin Cole):

Since the process to install WINE on mac can become involved, and Ubuntu is a useful
 system to have for many other reasons, 
I recommend building an Ubuntu virtualbox, then 
installing WINE & WinBugs on that machine using Jen's instructions. 

Instructions for building 
a virtualbox on Mac can be found below (despite being two years old, it's still accurate).
